# Detection-of-Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Using-Machine-Learning
In this repository, fetched the Chronic kidney disease dataset from UCI repository and did the complete analysis on the same and main goal was to predict whether an individual will have chronic kidney disease or not based on the data provided.

Chronic Kidney condition is associated with the increased morbidity and mortality, a high risk of many other diseases including cardiovascular disease, and high health care costs.
Over two million people worldwide receive dialysis or kidney transplant treatment to stay alive, yet this number may represent only 10% of people who need treatment to live.
Thus, there is significant importance in the early detection, controlling, and managing of the disease.

Dataset of prediction of chronic kidney disease using machine learning algorithm is downloaded from
UCI repository. In that dataset there are 400 patient records are included. Also they include 25 attributes but we take
only 14 attributes for building model. Age, Blood pressure, Albumin, Red blood cells, Pus cell, Pus cells clumps,
Serum creatinine, Haemoglobin, White blood cell count, Red blood cell count, Anaemia, Classification, Appetite,
Packed cell volume all this 14 attributes are used to build model.
